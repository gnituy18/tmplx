# tmplx

## Introduction
tmplx is a framework for building full-stack web applications using only Go and HTML. Its goal is to make building web apps simple, intuitive, and fun again. It significantly reduces cognitive load by:

- keeping frontend and backend logic close together
- providing reactive UI updates driven by Go variables
- requiring zero new syntax

Developing with tmplx feels like writing a more intuitive version of Go templates where the UI magically becomes reactive.

> [!WARNING]
> The project is in active development, with some of the features incomplete, and bugs or undefined behavior may occur.
